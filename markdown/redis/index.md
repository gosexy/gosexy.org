# gosexy/redis

This package provides bindings for the official [Redis][1] client, [hiredis][2].

The complete set of commands for the 2.6.10 release is supported.

The [project repo][9] at github includes some [benchmarks][8] that you may also
find interesting.

## How to install

```
go get menteslibres.net/gosexy/redis
```

## Usage

Install the package with `go get` and use `import` to include it in your project.

```
import "menteslibres.net/gosexy/redis"
```

The `redis.New()` function returns a `*redis.Client` struct that you can then
use to interact with your redis server.

```go
var client *redis.Client

client = redis.New()

err = client.Connect(host, port)

if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Connect failed: %s\n", err.Error())
  return
}

log.Println("Connected to redis-server.")

log.Printf("Sending PING...\n")
s, err = client.Ping()

if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Could not ping: %s\n", err.Error())
  return
}

log.Printf("Received %s!\n", s)

client.Quit()
```

This is the expected output of the above
[ping-pong example](https://github.com/gosexy/redis/tree/master/_examples/test-ping/main.go):

```
2013/02/19 07:15:52 Connected to redis-server.
2013/02/19 07:15:52 Sending PING...
2013/02/19 07:15:52 Received PONG!
```

Remember to use `client.Quit()` to close the client connection.

## Examples

Some examples are included.

* [PING and PONG](https://github.com/gosexy/redis/tree/master/_examples/test-ping/main.go)
* [GET, SET, and lists](https://github.com/gosexy/redis/tree/master/_examples/test-get-set/main.go)
* [RANGE](https://github.com/gosexy/redis/tree/master/_examples/test-range/main.go)
* [Using redis.Client.Command()](https://github.com/gosexy/redis/tree/master/_examples/test-custom-commands/main.go)
* [Using SUBSCRIBE](https://github.com/gosexy/redis/tree/master/_examples/test-subscribe/main.go)
* [Using SUBSCRIBE, another approach](https://github.com/gosexy/redis/tree/master/_examples/test-subscribe-2/main.go)

### Simple SET and GET

An example on how to use `*redis.Client` to send `SET` and `GET`
commands to the client.

```go
var client *redis.Client
var err error

client = redis.New()

err = client.Connect(host, port)

if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Connect failed: %s\n", err.Error())
  return
}

log.Println("Connected to redis-server.")

// DEL hello
log.Printf("DEL hello\n")
client.Del("hello")

// SET hello 1
log.Printf("SET hello 1\n")
client.Set("hello", 1)

// INCR hello
log.Printf("INCR hello\n")
client.Incr("hello")

// GET hello
log.Printf("GET hello\n")
s, err = client.Get("hello")

if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Could not GET: %s\n", err.Error())
  return
}

log.Printf("> hello = %s\n", s)

client.Quit()
```

This is the expected output of the above
[set-get example](https://github.com/gosexy/redis/tree/master/_examples/test-get-set/main.go):

```
2013/02/19 07:19:37 Connected to redis-server.
2013/02/19 07:19:37 DEL hello
2013/02/19 07:19:37 SET hello 1
2013/02/19 07:19:37 INCR hello
2013/02/19 07:19:37 GET hello
2013/02/19 07:19:37 > hello = 2
```

### Subscriptions

You can use `SUBSCRIBE` and `PSUBSCRIBE` with [channels][3] and
[goroutines][4] inside a non-blocking connection. You can create a non-blocking
connection using the `ConnectNonBlock` or `ConnectUnixNonBlock` functions.

```go
go consumer.Subscribe(rec, "channel")

var ls []string

for {
  ls = <-rec
  log.Printf("Consumer received: %v\n", strings.Join(ls, ", "))
}
```

The above snippet is part of a
[subscription example](https://github.com/gosexy/redis/tree/master/_examples/test-subscribe-2/main.go),
if you run the full example you'll see something like this:

```
2013/02/19 07:25:33 Consumer received: message, channel, Hello world!
2013/02/19 07:25:33 Consumer received: message, channel, Do you know how to count?
2013/02/19 07:25:33 Consumer received: message, channel, 0
2013/02/19 07:25:33 Consumer received: message, channel, 1
2013/02/19 07:25:33 Consumer received: message, channel, 2
```
