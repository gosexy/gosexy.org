# Isn't Go sexy enough?

Well, yes. [Go][1] is already a sexy programming language with many rich features, we are not really adding anything to the
language, we are just trying to make [Go][1] code easier to understand, code and hack. We love [Go][1].

## Making it even sexier

That's the challenge and these are our goals:

* Use Go custom types to achieve great code expressiveness.
* Hide complexity into the wrappers, try to make coding Go simpler.
* Get sexy.

Please, read our [getting started](/getting-started) page to see a real world example.
