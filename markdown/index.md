## The project

The goal of this project is to get fun by creating experiments, [cgo][3]
wrappers and pure [Go][1] libraries that could be used by other [Go][1]
learners while mastering their path in the language.

## The toolbelt

All these libraries are licensed under the [MIT license][4], so they're all
free for commercial, non-commercial, private and public use.

* [gosexy/db](/gosexy/db) Database abstraction for SQL and NoSQL databases.
* [gosexy/canvas](/gosexy/canvas) Image manipulation library on top of
ImageMagick's MagickWand (cgo).
* [gosexy/to](/gosexy/to) Type conversion utilities.
* [gosexy/dig](/gosexy/dig) A library that makes easy traversing maps and
digging into nested values.
* [gosexy/redis](/gosexy/redis) A redis client.
* [gosexy/yaml](/gosexy/yaml) A YAML reader (goyaml wrapper).
* [gosexy/checksum](/gosexy/checksum) Utilily methods for generating crypto
hashes of strings and files.

## Motivation

My name is [Jos√© Carlos][5].

I started to learn [Go][1] since [1.0][7] and so long it has been a refreshing
ride. I am far from being an expert, but I really enjoy the language, it makes
everyday coding happier for me. "gosexy" is a pun-intended name for a set of
utilities I've produced in my learning journey and that I still use.

Feel free to browse the source at the project's [github repo][6], use it,
comment on it, criticize it, fork it and *hack* it.

And please, don't hesitate to [drop me a line](jose.carlos@menteslibres.org) if
you need anything or even if you just want to say hi :-).
