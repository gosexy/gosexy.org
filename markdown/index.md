# What's gosexy.org about?

I started to learn [Go][1] since [1.0][7] and, so long, it has been a refreshing
ride.

The goal of this project is to get fun by creating [cgo][3] wrappers and pure
[Go][1] libraries that could be used by any other [Go][1] learners while
mastering their path on the language.

All these libraries are licensed under the [MIT license][4], and that means
that they're all free for commercial, non-commercial, private and public use.

At this time, [gosexy.org][2] is a [one person project][5], but I don't lose my
hope the team can be expanded someday :-).

You can browse the code at our [github repo][6], feel free to use it,
comment on it, criticize it, fork it and hack it.

When in doubt, join the IRC channel, #menteslibres at freenode.
